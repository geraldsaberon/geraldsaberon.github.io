The [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) board game along with an AI opponent implemented using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.

The [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm is used for the AI. [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) is also incorporated for the Minimax algorithm to enhance performance and efficiency.

Multiple heuristics are used for the evaluation for the Minimax algorithm such as coin parity, mobility, captured corners and static weights.
